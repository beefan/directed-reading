### Attention, the new oil?

Your attention is a central resource of the digital era. And it's unavoidably fragmented through information overload. 
This application helps to draw in the focus as you read your daily articles. Simply click to start/stop the flow. One word at a time is highlighted as your attention goes down the page. 

The hope is that this extension can aid faster, less fragmented digestion of digital information.
